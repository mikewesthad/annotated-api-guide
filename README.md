# Annotated List of Web APIs

This is an annotated list of Web APIs that are great for learning and experimenting in JavaScript. The APIs are broken down into categories based on how you need to connect to them.

This list is a collection of APIs I've used along with many pulled from afeld's [gist](https://gist.github.com/afeld/4952991). This is a work-in-progress. To do:

-   Finish integrating other mega-lists of APIs and annotating them
-   Add some sample code for how to get JSON and JSONP
-   Add a section explaining CORS
-   Add a section on proxying HTTPS
-   Add a section on CORS proxies like <http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/> or <http://crossorigin.me/>

## General format of API notes

Each API has a description that should look like this:

-   Name & URL to documentation
-   Any important information about the API
    -   Quirks
    -   Details of the rate limits
    -   Whether or not the API is configured for CORS
-   Protocols: can you connect using HTTP or HTTPS?
-   Formats: what data formats does the API support (JSON, XML, etc.)?

## APIs that are completely public

No API key is necessary or there is a public API key that is freely available. These are great for quick testing and learning about APIs.

-   [Giphy](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)
    -   Access to GIFs from Giphy
    -   Requires a key, but there is a public key available for experimentation & development
    -   Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
    -   Formats: JSON, HTML
    -   CORS: Yes
-   [Hipsterjesus](http://hipsterjesus.com/)
    -   Hipster ipsum generator

    -   CORS: Yes
-   [jService](http://jservice.io/)
    -   Collection of trivia questions aired on Jeopardy
    -   Protocols: HTTP
    -   Formats: JSON
    -   CORS: Yes

    -   Get info about artists, releases, labels, etc.
    -   240 requests per minute per IP address without authorization
    -   Some resources (like the search endpoint) require a [authentication](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:authentication). You can sign up and use a user token as an easy way to access those resources (e.g. adding `&token=YOURTOKEN` to the URL).
    -   Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
    -   Formats: JSON, JSONP
    -   CORS: Yes
-   [The Cat API](http://thecatapi.com/) (more complete access with API key)
    -   Free access to `/api/images/get` endpoint without an API key
    -   Does not support JSON/JSONP yet, but can return an HTML image tag
    -   Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
    -   Formats: XML, HTML, SRC
    -   CORS: Yes
-   [COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/api)
    -   Get colors/palettes
    -   Default format is xml, so add `format=json` for data in JSON format
    -   If you are making a request from the JS in the browser, you will need to use JSONP with the parameter name `jsonCallback`
    -   Protocols: HTTP
    -   Formats: XML, JSON, JSONP
    -   CORS: No
-   [Robothash](https://robohash.org/) (pass in anything after the URL to get a robot image)

    -   Returns an image, so create an `img` with src pointing to the URL
    -   Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
    -   Formats: Image
    -   CORS: No
-   [Dronestre.am](http://dronestre.am/)

    -   Formats: JSON, JSONP
    -   CORS: No
-   [TVMaze API](http://www.tvmaze.com/api)

-   [Netflix Roulette](http://netflixroulette.net/api/)
-   [NFLArrest API](http://nflarrest.com/api/)

## APIs that require an API key but do not private credentials

These APIs require you to register to get an API key, which then you use in your API requests. None of these APIs require server-side techniques to get access.

These are great for experimenting and learning, but if you are creating a final product (art installation, web app, etc.), you probably don't want your API key to be easily accessible in a public website. If someone reads your source code, they could get your API key and use up your allotted API calls.
